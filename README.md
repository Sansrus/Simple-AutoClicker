# Simple AutoClicker
A simple AutoClicker for Minecraft fabric that can perform some actions instead of the player

# Auto-clicks
Actions that an autoclicker can perform instead of the player:
- Walk Forward
- Walk Backward
- Walk Right
- Walk Left
- Jump
- Sneak
- Use Item
- Attack entity/Break blocks

# How to use the mod?
You can open the mod's config through modmenu or in the game by pressing F4.
In the config, you can customize the operation of a separate auto-click. 
You can change:
- Autoclick functionality (enable or disable)
- Autoclick name
- Waiting period (in ticks)
- Autoclick usage time (in ticks)
- Delete this autoclick


# Working with ticks
The entire mod works on ticks of the internal client, not on seconds. This should be taken into account when setting your delay.
There is also a spam mode. This is a mode where the waiting time is set to 0, and the action is repeated every tick without stopping
